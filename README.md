Palindrome fixed. allowed to check the first character with the last.

Problem 5 created proper .cpp file. read file word by word and then put into 
array of strings. reversed array and outputed line by line.

Problem 6.1 Was able to get it to work. 
finished func alloc_chars
returns a char* that points directly to buffer array
updates buffer array in proper spot
finished func free_chars
locates beginning char value in char* p 
re-iterizes all values in char* p and after to null char

Problem 6.2 Unable to complete
Was able to complete most of alloc_chars
able to create dynamic mem_blocks and able to have them update the buffer
unable to utilize active requests and if the me_block was too large or small
free_chars locates the beginning of the char* p and then
iterizes the values upto n to the null char
