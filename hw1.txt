Problem 6 part 1 question 3
If we want to delete a array from the buffer we initialize, from its 
starting postion to the end as '\0' which means we would also delete
any other array of chars that appear after the ones we want to delete.
In addition to just deleting the array of chars we want, we delete anything that may come after it as well.
